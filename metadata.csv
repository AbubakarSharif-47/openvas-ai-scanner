"vulnerability: GoCD is a continuous deliver server. GoCD versions 18.9.0 through 24.4.0 (inclusive) can allow GoCD admins to abuse the backup configuration ""post-backup script"" feature to potentially execute arbitrary scripts on the hosting server or container as GoCD's user, rather than pre-configured scripts. In practice the impact of this vulnerability is limited, as in most configurations a user who can log into the GoCD UI as an admin also has host administration permissions for the host/container that GoCD runs on, in order to manage artifact storage and other service-level configuration options. Additionally, since a GoCD admin has ability to configure and schedule pipelines tasks on all GoCD agents available to the server, the fundamental functionality of GoCD allows co-ordinated task execution similar to that of post-backup-scripts. However in restricted environments where the host administration is separated from the role of a GoCD admin, this may be unexpected. The issue is fixed in GoCD 24.5.0. Post-backup scripts can no longer be executed from within certain sensitive locations on the GoCD server. No known workarounds are available. cvss: 3.8",The issue is fixed in GoCD 24.5.0.

"vulnerability: Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. Starting in version 13.0.0 and prior to versions 13.5.8, 14.2.21, and 15.1.2, Next.js is vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack that allows attackers to construct requests that leaves requests to Server Actions hanging until the hosting provider cancels the function execution. This vulnerability can also be used as a Denial of Wallet (DoW) attack when deployed in providers billing by response times. (Note: Next.js server is idle during that time and only keeps the connection open. CPU and memory footprint are low during that time.). Deployments without any protection against long running Server Action invocations are especially vulnerable. Hosting providers like Vercel or Netlify set a default maximum duration on function execution to reduce the risk of excessive billing. This is the same issue as if the incoming HTTP request has an invalid `Content-Length` header or never closes. If the host has no other mitigations to those then this vulnerability is novel. This vulnerability affects only Next.js deployments using Server Actions. The issue was resolved in Next.js 13.5.8, 14.2.21, and 15.1.2. We recommend that users upgrade to a safe version.

"vulnerability: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: check folio mapping after unlock in relocate_one_folio()

When we call btrfs_read_folio() to bring a folio uptodate, we unlock the
folio. The result of that is that a different thread can modify the
mapping (like remove it with invalidate) before we call folio_lock().
This results in an invalid page and we need to try again.

In particular, if we are relocating concurrently with aborting a
transaction, this can result in a crash like the following:

destroy_delalloc_inodes() which calls invalidate_inode_pages2() which
takes the folio_lock before setting mapping to NULL. We fail to check
this, and subsequently call set_extent_mapping(), which assumes that
mapping != NULL (in fact it asserts that in debug mode)

"vulnerability: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

btrfs: fix use-after-free when COWing tree bock and tracing is enabled

When a COWing a tree block, at btrfs_cow_block(), and we have the
tracepoint trace_btrfs_cow_block() enabled and preemption is also enabled
(CONFIG_PREEMPT=y), we can trigger a use-after-free in the COWed extent
buffer while inside the tracepoint code. This is because in some paths
that call btrfs_cow_block(), such as btrfs_search_slot(), we are holding
the last reference on the extent buffer @buf so btrfs_force_cow_block()
drops the last reference on the @buf extent buffer when it calls
free_extent_buffer_stale(buf), which schedules the release of the extent
buffer with RCU. This means that if we are on a kernel with preemption,
the current task may be preempted before calling trace_btrfs_cow_block()
and the extent buffer already released by the time trace_btrfs_cow_block()
is called, resulting in a use-after-free.

Fix this by moving the trace_btrfs_cow_block() from btrfs_cow_block() to
btrfs_force_cow_block() before the COWed extent buffer is freed.
This also has a side effect of invoking the tracepoint in the tree defrag
code, at defrag.c:btrfs_realloc_node(), since btrfs_force_cow_block() is
called there, but this is fine and it was actually missing there. cvss: 7.8","In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

"vulnerability: A vulnerability in Crater Invoice allows an unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of the APP_KEY to achieve remote command execution on the server by manipulating the laravel_session cookie, exploiting arbitrary deserialization through the encrypted session data. The exploitation vector of this vulnerability relies on an attacker obtaining Laravel's secret APP_KEY, which would allow them to decrypt and manipulate session cookies (laravel_session) containing serialized data. By altering this data and re-encrypting it with the APP_KEY, the attacker could trigger arbitrary deserialization on the server, potentially leading to remote command execution (RCE). The vulnerability is primarily exploited by accessing an exposed cookie and manipulating it using the secret key to gain malicious access to the server. cvss: 9.8","1.

"vulnerability: ClipBucket V5 provides open source video hosting with PHP. During the user avatar upload workflow, a user can choose to upload and change their avatar at any time. During deletion, ClipBucket checks for the avatar_url as a filepath within the avatars subdirectory. If the URL path exists within the avatars directory, ClipBucket will delete it. There is no check for path traversal sequences in the provided user input (stored in the DB as avatar_url) therefore the final $file variable could be tainted with path traversal sequences.

"vulnerability: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/sched: netem: account for backlog updates from child qdisc

In general, 'qlen' of any classful qdisc should keep track of the
number of packets that the qdisc itself and all of its children holds.
In case of netem, 'qlen' only accounts for the packets in its internal
tfifo. When netem is used with a child qdisc, the child qdisc can use
'qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog' to inform its parent, netem, about created
or dropped SKBs. This function updates 'qlen' and the backlog statistics
of netem, but netem does not account for changes made by a child qdisc.
'qlen' then indicates the wrong number of packets in the tfifo.
If a child qdisc creates new SKBs during enqueue and informs its parent
about this, netem's 'qlen' value is increased. When netem dequeues the
newly created SKBs from the child, the 'qlen' in netem is not updated.
If 'qlen' reaches the configured sch->limit, the enqueue function stops
working, even though the tfifo is not full.

Reproduce the bug:
Ensure that the sender machine has GSO enabled. Configure netem as root
qdisc and tbf as its child on the outgoing interface of the machine
as follows:
$ tc qdisc add dev <oif> root handle 1: netem delay 100ms limit 100
$ tc qdisc add dev <oif> parent 1:0 tbf rate 50Mbit burst 1542 latency 50ms

Send bulk TCP traffic out via this interface, e.g., by running an iPerf3
client on the machine. Check the qdisc statistics:
$ tc -s qdisc show dev <oif>

Statistics after 10s of iPerf3 TCP test before the fix (note that
netem's backlog > limit, netem stopped accepting packets):
qdisc netem 1: root refcnt 2 limit 1000 delay 100ms
 Sent 2767766 bytes 1848 pkt (dropped 652, overlimits 0 requeues 0)
 backlog 4294528236b 1155p requeues 0
qdisc tbf 10: parent 1:1 rate 50Mbit burst 1537b lat 50ms
 Sent 2767766 bytes 1848 pkt (dropped 327, overlimits 7601 requeues 0)
 backlog 0b 0p requeues 0

Statistics after the fix:
qdisc netem 1: root refcnt 2 limit 1000 delay 100ms
 Sent 37766372 bytes 24974 pkt (dropped 9, overlimits 0 requeues 0)

 Sent 37766372 bytes 24974 pkt (dropped 327, overlimits 96017 requeues 0)
 backlog 0b 0p requeues 0

tbf segments the GSO SKBs (tbf_segment) and updates the netem's 'qlen'.
The interface fully stops transferring packets and ""locks"". In this case,
the child qdisc and tfifo are empty, but 'qlen' indicates the tfifo is at
its limit and no more packets are accepted.

This patch adds a counter for the entries in the tfifo. Netem's 'qlen' is
only decreased when a packet is returned by its dequeue function, and not
during enqueuing into the child qdisc. External updates to 'qlen' are thus
accounted for and only the behavior of the backlog statistics changes. As
in other qdiscs, 'qlen' then keeps track of  how many packets are held in
netem and all of its children. As before, sch->limit remains as the
maximum number of packets in the tfifo. The same applies to netem's
backlog statistics. cvss: 5.5","Check the qdisc statistics:

nfsd: fix nfs4_openowner leak when concurrent nfsd4_open occur

The action force umount(umount -f) will attempt to kill all rpc_task even
umount operation may ultimately fail if some files remain open.
Consequently, if an action attempts to open a file, it can potentially
send two rpc_task to nfs server.

While processing an open request, nfsd will first attempt to find or
allocate an nfs4_openowner. If it finds an nfs4_openowner that is not
marked as NFS4_OO_CONFIRMED, this nfs4_openowner will released. Since
two rpc_task can attempt to open the same file simultaneously from the
client to server, and because two instances of nfsd can run
concurrently, this situation can lead to lots of memory leak.
Additionally, when we echo 0 to /proc/fs/nfsd/threads, warning will be

"vulnerability: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

bpf: put bpf_link's program when link is safe to be deallocated

In general, BPF link's underlying BPF program should be considered to be
reachable through attach hook -> link -> prog chain, and, pessimistically,
we have to assume that as long as link's memory is not safe to free,
attach hook's code might hold a pointer to BPF program and use it.

As such, it's not (generally) correct to put link's program early before
waiting for RCU GPs to go through. More eager bpf_prog_put() that we
currently do is mostly correct due to BPF program's release code doing
similar RCU GP waiting, but as will be shown in the following patches,
BPF program can be non-sleepable (and, thus, reliant on only ""classic""
RCU GP), while BPF link's attach hook can have sleepable semantics and
needs to be protected by RCU Tasks Trace, and for such cases BPF link
has to go through RCU Tasks Trace + ""classic"" RCU GPs before being
deallocated. And so, if we put BPF program early, we might free BPF
program before we free BPF link, leading to use-after-free situation.

So, this patch defers bpf_prog_put() until we are ready to perform
bpf_link's deallocation. At worst, this delays BPF program freeing by
one extra RCU GP, but that seems completely acceptable. Alternatively,
we'd need more elaborate ways to determine BPF hook, BPF link, and BPF
program lifetimes, and how they relate to each other, which seems like
an unnecessary complication.

Note, for most BPF links we still will perform eager bpf_prog_put() and
link dealloc, so for those BPF links there are no observable changes
whatsoever. Only BPF links that use deferred dealloc might notice
slightly delayed freeing of BPF programs.

Also, to reduce code and logic duplication, extract program put + link
dealloc logic into bpf_link_dealloc() helper. cvss: 5.5","More eager bpf_prog_put() that we

"vulnerability: The <redacted>.so library, which is used by <redacted>, is
vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the code that handles the deletion
of certificates. This buffer overflow can be triggered by providing a
long file path to the <redacted> action of the <redacted>.exe CGI binary or
to the <redacted>.sh CGI script. This binary or script will write this
file path to <redacted>, which is then
read by <redacted>.so


This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC models before version 24120701.

Likelihood: Moderate – An attacker will have to find this exploit by
either obtaining the binaries involved in this vulnerability, or by trial
and error. Furthermore, the attacker will need a (low privilege)
account to gain access to the <redacted>.exe CGI binary or <redacted>.sh
script to trigger the vulnerability, or convince a user with such access
send an HTTP request that triggers it.


Impact: High – The <redacted> process, which we assume is
responsible for OCPP communication, will keep crashing after
performing the exploit. This happens because the buffer overflow
causes the process to segfault before
<redacted> is removed. This means that,
even though <redacted> is automatically restarted, it will crash
again as soon as it tries to parse the text file.

"vulnerability: There are many buffer overflow vulnerabilities present in several CGI binaries of the charging station.This issue affects Iocharger firmware for AC model chargers beforeversion 24120701.

Likelihood: High – Given the prevalence of these buffer overflows, and the clear error message of the web server, an attacker is very likely to be able to find these vulnerabilities.

Impact: Low – Usually, overflowing one of these buffers just causes a segmentation fault of the CGI binary, which causes the web server to return a 502 Bad Gateway error. However the webserver itself is not affected, and no DoS can be achieved. Abusing these buffer overflows in a meaningful way requires highly technical knowledge, especially since ASLR also seems to be enabled on the charging station. However, a skilled attacker might be able to use one of these buffer overflows to obtain remote code execution.

"vulnerability: Strawberry GraphQL is a library for creating GraphQL APIs. Starting in 0.182.0 and prior to version 0.257.0, a type confusion vulnerability exists in Strawberry GraphQL's relay integration that affects multiple ORM integrations (Django, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic). The vulnerability occurs when multiple GraphQL types are mapped to the same underlying model while using the relay node interface. When querying for a specific type using the global node field (e.g., FruitType:some-id), the resolver may incorrectly return an instance of a different type mapped to the same model (e.g., SpecialFruitType). This can lead to information disclosure if the alternate type exposes sensitive fields and potential privilege escalation if the alternate type contains data intended for restricted access. This vulnerability is fixed in 0.257.0. cvss: 3.7","This vulnerability is fixed in 0.257.0.

"vulnerability: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

dlm: fix possible lkb_resource null dereference

This patch fixes a possible null pointer dereference when this function is
called from request_lock() as lkb->lkb_resource is not assigned yet,
only after validate_lock_args() by calling attach_lkb(). Another issue
is that a resource name could be a non printable bytearray and we cannot
assume to be ASCII coded.

The log functionality is probably never being hit when DLM is used in
normal way and no debug logging is enabled. The null pointer dereference
can only occur on a new created lkb that does not have the resource
assigned yet, it probably never hits the null pointer dereference but we
should be sure that other changes might not change this behaviour and we
actually can hit the mentioned null pointer dereference.

In this patch we just drop the printout of the resource name, the lkb id
is enough to make a possible connection to a resource name if this
exists. cvss: 5.5","In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

"vulnerability: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

block: Prevent potential deadlocks in zone write plug error recovery

Zone write plugging for handling writes to zones of a zoned block
device always execute a zone report whenever a write BIO to a zone
fails. The intent of this is to ensure that the tracking of a zone write
pointer is always correct to ensure that the alignment to a zone write
pointer of write BIOs can be checked on submission and that we can
always correctly emulate zone append operations using regular write
BIOs.

However, this error recovery scheme introduces a potential deadlock if a
device queue freeze is initiated while BIOs are still plugged in a zone
write plug and one of these write operation fails. In such case, the
disk zone write plug error recovery work is scheduled and executes a
report zone. This in turn can result in a request allocation in the
underlying driver to issue the report zones command to the device. But
with the device queue freeze already started, this allocation will
block, preventing the report zone execution and the continuation of the
processing of the plugged BIOs. As plugged BIOs hold a queue usage
reference, the queue freeze itself will never complete, resulting in a
deadlock.

Avoid this problem by completely removing from the zone write plugging
code the use of report zones operations after a failed write operation,
instead relying on the device user to either execute a report zones,
reset the zone, finish the zone, or give up writing to the device (which
is a fairly common pattern for file systems which degrade to read-only
after write failures). This is not an unreasonnable requirement as all
well-behaved applications, FSes and device mapper already use report
zones to recover from write errors whenever possible by comparing the
current position of a zone write pointer with what their assumption
about the position is.

The changes to remove the automatic error recovery are as follows:
 - Completely remove the error recovery work and its associated
   resources (zone write plug list head, disk error list, and disk
   zone_wplugs_work work struct). This also removes the functions
   disk_zone_wplug_set_error() and disk_zone_wplug_clear_error().

 - Change the BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_ERROR zone write plug flag into
   BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE. This new flag is set for a zone write
   plug whenever a write opration targetting the zone of the zone write
   plug fails. This flag indicates that the zone write pointer offset is
   not reliable and that it must be updated when the next report zone,
   reset zone, finish zone or disk revalidation is executed.

 - Modify blk_zone_write_plug_bio_endio() to set the
   BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE flag for the target zone of a failed
   write BIO.

 - Modify the function disk_zone_wplug_set_wp_offset() to clear this
   new flag, thus implementing recovery of a correct write pointer
   offset with the reset (all) zone and finish zone operations.

 - Modify blkdev_report_zones() to always use the disk_report_zones_cb()
   callback so that disk_zone_wplug_sync_wp_offset() can be called for
   any zone marked with the BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE flag.
   This implements recovery of a correct write pointer offset for zone
   write plugs marked with BLK_ZONE_WPLUG_NEED_WP_UPDATE and within
   the range of the report zones operation executed by the user.

 - Modify blk_revalidate_seq_zone() to call
   disk_zone_wplug_sync_wp_offset() for all sequential write required
   zones when a zoned block device is revalidated, thus always resolving
   any inconsistency between the write pointer offset of zone write
   plugs and the actual write pointer position of sequential zones. cvss: 5.5","1. Keep all software updated to the latest version.

"vulnerability: In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

Drivers: hv: util: Avoid accessing a ringbuffer not initialized yet

If the KVP (or VSS) daemon starts before the VMBus channel's ringbuffer is
fully initialized, we can hit the panic below:

hv_utils: Registering HyperV Utility Driver
hv_vmbus: registering driver hv_utils
...
BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 0000000000000000
CPU: 44 UID: 0 PID: 2552 Comm: hv_kvp_daemon Tainted: G E 6.11.0-rc3+ #1

 kvp_register_done
 hvt_op_read
 vfs_read
 ksys_read
 __x64_sys_read

This can happen because the KVP/VSS channel callback can be invoked
even before the channel is fully opened:
1) as soon as hv_kvp_init() -> hvutil_transport_init() creates
/dev/vmbus/hv_kvp, the kvp daemon can open the device file immediately and
register itself to the driver by writing a message KVP_OP_REGISTER1 to the
file (which is handled by kvp_on_msg() ->kvp_handle_handshake()) and
reading the file for the driver's response, which is handled by
hvt_op_read(), which calls hvt->on_read(), i.e. kvp_register_done().

2) the problem with kvp_register_done() is that it can cause the
channel callback to be called even before the channel is fully opened,
and when the channel callback is starting to run, util_probe()->
vmbus_open() may have not initialized the ringbuffer yet, so the
callback can hit the panic of NULL pointer dereference.

To reproduce the panic consistently, we can add a ""ssleep(10)"" for KVP in
__vmbus_open(), just before the first hv_ringbuffer_init(), and then we
unload and reload the driver hv_utils, and run the daemon manually within
the 10 seconds.

Fix the panic by reordering the steps in util_probe() so the char dev
entry used by the KVP or VSS daemon is not created until after
vmbus_open() has completed. This reordering prevents the race condition
from happening. cvss: 5.5","

arm64: ptrace: fix partial SETREGSET for NT_ARM_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL

Currently tagged_addr_ctrl_set() doesn't initialize the temporary 'ctrl'
variable, and a SETREGSET call with a length of zero will leave this
uninitialized. Consequently tagged_addr_ctrl_set() will consume an
arbitrary value, potentially leaking up to 64 bits of memory from the
kernel stack. The read is limited to a specific slot on the stack, and
the issue does not provide a write mechanism.

As set_tagged_addr_ctrl() only accepts values where bits [63:4] zero and
rejects other values, a partial SETREGSET attempt will randomly succeed
or fail depending on the value of the uninitialized value, and the
exposure is significantly limited.

Fix this by initializing the temporary value before copying the regset
from userspace, as for other regsets (e.g. NT_PRSTATUS, NT_PRFPREG,
NT_ARM_SYSTEM_CALL). In the case of a zero-length write, the existing
value of the tagged address ctrl will be retained.

The NT_ARM_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL regset is only visible in the
user_aarch64_view used by a native AArch64 task to manipulate another
native AArch64 task. As get_tagged_addr_ctrl() only returns an error
value when called for a compat task, tagged_addr_ctrl_get() and

"vulnerability: CloudStack users can add and read comments (annotations) on resources they are authorised to access. 

Due to an access validation issue that affects Apache CloudStack versions from 4.16.0, users who have access, prior access or knowledge of resource UUIDs can list and add comments (annotations) to such resources. 

An attacker with a user-account and access or prior knowledge of resource UUIDs may exploit this issue to read contents of the comments (annotations) or add malicious comments (annotations) to such resources. 

This may cause potential loss of confidentiality of CloudStack environments and resources if the comments (annotations) contain any privileged information. However, guessing or brute-forcing resource UUIDs are generally hard to impossible and access to listing or adding comments isn't same as access to CloudStack resources, making this issue of very low severity and general low impact.


CloudStack admins may also disallow listAnnotations and addAnnotation API access to non-admin roles in their environment as an interim measure. cvss: 4.3","1. Keep all software updated to the latest version.

"vulnerability: When switching to other buffers using the :all command and visual mode still being active, this may cause a heap-buffer overflow, because Vim does not properly end visual mode and therefore may try to access beyond the end of a line in a buffer. In Patch 9.1.1003 Vim will correctly reset the visual mode before opening other windows and buffers and therefore fix this bug. In addition it does verify that it won't try to access a position if the position is greater than the corresponding buffer line. Impact is medium since the user must have switched on visual mode when executing the :all ex command. The Vim project would like to thank github user gandalf4a for reporting this issue.

"vulnerability: notion-go is a collection of libraries for supporting sign and verify OCI artifacts. Based on Notary Project specifications. The issue was identified during Quarkslab's security audit on the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) based revocation check feature.
After retrieving the CRL, notation-go attempts to update the CRL cache using the os.Rename method. However, this operation may fail due to operating system-specific limitations, particularly when the source and destination paths are on different mount points. This failure could lead to an unexpected program termination. In method `crl.(*FileCache).Set`, a temporary file is created in the OS dedicated area (like /tmp for, usually, Linux/Unix). The file is written and then it is tried to move it to the dedicated `notation` cache directory thanks `os.Rename`. As specified in Go documentation, OS specific restriction may apply. When used with Linux OS, it is relying on rename syscall from the libc and as per the documentation, moving a file to a different mountpoint raises an EXDEV error, interpreted as Cross device link not permitted error. Some Linux distribution, like RedHat use a dedicated filesystem (tmpfs), mounted on a specific mountpoint (usually /tmp) for temporary files. When using such OS, revocation check based on CRL will repeatedly crash notation. As a result the signature verification process is aborted as process crashes. This issue has been addressed in version 1.3.0-rc.2 and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. cvss: 3.3","There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

"vulnerability: notion-go is a collection of libraries for supporting sign and verify OCI artifacts. Based on Notary Project specifications. This issue was identified during Quarkslab's audit of the timestamp feature. During the timestamp signature generation, the revocation status of the certificate(s) used to generate the timestamp signature was not verified. During timestamp signature generation, notation-go did not check the revocation status of the certificate chain used by the TSA. This oversight creates a vulnerability that could be exploited through a Man-in-The-Middle attack. An attacker could potentially use a compromised, intermediate, or revoked leaf certificate to generate a malicious countersignature, which would then be accepted and stored by `notation`. This could lead to denial of service scenarios, particularly in CI/CD environments during signature verification processes because timestamp signature would fail due to the presence of a revoked certificate(s) potentially disrupting operations. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.3.0-rc.2 and all users are advised to upgrade.

"vulnerability: A flaw was found in rsync. This vulnerability arises from a race condition during rsync's handling of symbolic links. Rsync's default behavior when encountering symbolic links is to skip them. If an attacker replaced a regular file with a symbolic link at the right time, it was possible to bypass the default behavior and traverse symbolic links. Depending on the privileges of the rsync process, an attacker could leak sensitive information, potentially leading to privilege escalation. cvss: 5.6","1.

"vulnerability: Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. When the Vyper Compiler uses the precompiles EcRecover (0x1) and Identity (0x4), the success flag of the call is not checked. As a consequence an attacker can provide a specific amount of gas to make these calls fail but let the overall execution continue. Then the execution result can be incorrect. Based on EVM's rules, after the failed precompile the remaining code has only 1/64 of the pre-call-gas left (as 63/64 were forwarded and spent). Hence, only fairly simple executions can follow the failed precompile calls. Therefore, we found no significantly impacted real-world contracts. None the less an advisory has been made out of an abundance of caution. This issue is fixed in 0.4.1. cvss: 7.5",This issue is fixed in 0.4.1.
"vulnerability: XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. NOTE: The Realtime WYSIWYG Editor extension was **experimental**, and thus **not recommended**, in the versions affected by this vulnerability. It has become enabled by default, and thus recommended, starting with XWiki 16.9.0. A user with only **edit right** can join a realtime editing session where others, that where already there or that may join later, have **script** or **programming** access rights. This user can then insert **script rendering macros** that are executed for those users in the realtime session that have script or programming rights. The inserted scripts can be used to gain more access rights. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.10.2, 16.4.1 and 16.6.0-rc-1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may either disable the realtime WYSIWYG editing by disabling the ``xwiki-realtime`` CKEditor plugin from the WYSIWYG editor administration section or uninstall the Realtime WYSIWYG Editorextension (org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-realtime-wysiwyg-ui). cvss: 9.0","This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.10.2, 16.4.1 and 16.6.0-rc-1."

"vulnerability: Open source machine learning framework. A vulnerability has been identified in Rasa that enables an attacker who has the ability to load a maliciously crafted model remotely into a Rasa instance to achieve Remote Code Execution. The prerequisites for this are: 1. The HTTP API must be enabled on the Rasa instance eg with `--enable-api`. This is not the default configuration. 2. For unauthenticated RCE to be exploitable, the user must not have configured any authentication or other security controls recommended in our documentation. 3. For authenticated RCE, the attacker must posses a valid authentication token or JWT to interact with the Rasa API. This issue has been addressed in rasa version 3.6.21 and all users are advised to upgrade.

"vulnerability: Git Credential Manager (GCM) is a secure Git credential helper built on .NET that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The Git credential protocol is text-based over standard input/output, and consists of a series of lines of key-value pairs in the format `key=value`. Git's documentation restricts the use of the NUL (`\0`) character and newlines to form part of the keys or values. When Git reads from standard input, it considers both LF and CRLF as newline characters for the credential protocol by virtue of calling `strbuf_getline` that calls to `strbuf_getdelim_strip_crlf`. Git also validates that a newline is not present in the value by checking for the presence of the line-feed character (LF, `\n`), and errors if this is the case. This captures both LF and CRLF-type newlines. Git Credential Manager uses the .NET standard library `StreamReader` class to read the standard input stream line-by-line and parse the `key=value` credential protocol format. The implementation of the `ReadLineAsync` method considers LF, CRLF, and CR as valid line endings. This is means that .NET considers a single CR as a valid newline character, whereas Git does not. This mismatch of newline treatment between Git and GCM means that an attacker can craft a malicious remote URL. When a user clones or otherwise interacts with a malicious repository that requires authentication, the attacker can capture credentials for another Git remote. The attack is also heightened when cloning from repositories with submodules when using the `--recursive` clone option as the user is not able to inspect the submodule remote URLs beforehand. This issue has been patched in version 2.6.1 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should only interact with trusted remote repositories, and not clone with `--recursive` to allow inspection of any submodule URLs before cloning those submodules. cvss: 7.4",This issue has been patched in version 2.6.1 and all users are advised to upgrade.
